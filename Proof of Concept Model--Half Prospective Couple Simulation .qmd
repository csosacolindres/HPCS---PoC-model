# Half-Prospective Couple Simulation: Proof-of-Concept Model

## Conceptual Model

### Background:

Couple Simulation might be able to predict who people will end up with (maybe *should* end up with). However, as it stands right now, couple simulation has only been retrospective---that is, has only reconstructed relationships that already exist.

Constructing a Prospective Couple Simulation study would be challenging with less-than-it's-worth gains: You'd need to design a longitudinal study with a closed mating market; longitudinal studies have high attrition, and closed mating markets (like isolated societies, retirement homes, etc) are unrepresentative and rare. Stacking on to the logistical challenges, replication would be challenging for any other researcher attempting to replicate the findings. However, this may be an inverted U problem where the solution to "what study design is ideal given the circumstances?" lies somewhere in the middle.

A Half-Prospective Couple Simulation could serve to mitigate the challenges of a full Prospective Couple Simulation. Here we can compare alternative models (Random, GSA, RAM) to prospectively predict the *KINDS* of partners people choose. This design is cheaper, easier, and reproducible---it does not require a closed market, or dyadic data so gathering a large uncoupled population can help attrition rates.

### The Proof-of-Concept Model:

To test whether in fact a Half-Prospective Couple Simulation could be a good alternative to a full Prospective Couple Simulation, we need to construct a proof-of-concept model.

What is the Proof-of-Concept Model for the Half-Prospective Couple Simulation design?

![](images/Screenshot%202023-07-18%20at%201.22.50%20PM.png)

Here, the key questions are:

1.  Are secondary partners significantly more similar to primary partners than expected by chance?

2.  Does this not happen when choice is random with respect to preferences?

3.  Are matches significantly more similar when the secondary mate choice model matches the primary?

```

### Section 5: Answer Key Questions

1.  Are secondary partners significantly more similar to primary partners than expected by chance

    -   Compare Secondary Partners to Primary Partner

Make Function for these comparisions

```{r}


partnerSimilarity <- function(pp, sc, random = F) {
  partnerSim <- rep(NA, nrow(pp))
  for (p in 1:nrow(pp)) {
    if (random == F) {
      ppPartner <- pp$modelguess[p]
      
    } else {
      ppPartner <-
        pp$modelguess[sample((1:nrow(pp))[pp$sex == pp$sex[p]], 1)]
    }
    
    scPartner <- sc$modelguess[sc$PIN == pp$PIN[p]]
    
    if (!(is.na(ppPartner)) & !(is.na(scPartner))) {
      partnerSim[p] <-
        dist(rbind(pp[pp$PIN == ppPartner, 18:33],
                   sc[sc$PIN == scPartner, 18:33]))
    }
  }
  return(partnerSim)
}

```

Compare primary partners & split combine partners:

Loop partnerSimiliarity for mean. Store pvalues to take proportion of times when gsa, ram etc, is less than .05 --- take count for proportion. & loop through multiple sample sizes (ex. popsize \<- 1000, then 500, 250, etc).

RAM has an "advantage" right now because we are not counting NA

```{r}

# loop partnerSImilairies for means
